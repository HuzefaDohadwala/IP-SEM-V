Install Node.js (if not already installed):
If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/. Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

Open a command-line terminal:
Once Node.js is installed, open your terminal or command prompt.

Start a Node.js REPL session:
To start an interactive Node.js session, simply type node and press Enter in your command-line terminal. You should see a prompt (>) that allows you to enter JavaScript code.

Write Your JavaScript Function:
In the Node.js REPL, you can write your JavaScript functions directly. For example, to create a simple function that adds two numbers, you can type the following:


function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

Test Your Function:
After writing your function, you can test it by calling it with different arguments. 

For example:
addNumbers(5, 3); // This will execute the function and return the result.

View the Output:
The output of your function call will be displayed in the REPL, and you'll see the return value.

you can refer to calci.js for other basic codes such as multiply , divide , factorial and simple interest
